# Twitch Network Analysis - English/British Streamers

This notebook analyzes the Twitch ENGB network dataset and compares it with artificial networks (Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert models). We'll examine network properties, visualize distributions, and identify important nodes in the network.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Twitch user-user networks of English/British streamers
- **Nodes**: Twitch users
- **Edges**: Mutual friendships between users
- **Features**: Based on games played/liked, location, and streaming habits
- **Target Variable**: Whether a streamer uses explicit language (binary classification)
